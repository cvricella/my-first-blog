            <h1><em><u>About Me and This Site</em></u></h1>
            <p> Hi! My name is Carl Vricella and I am an aspiring environmental scientist who specializes in spatial analysis. I hold a B.S in Environmental
                Science and I am currently pursuing a Masters Certification in Geo Spatial Science. I have worked for Non-profits
                doing spatial modeling/analysis and for consulting firms performing figure creation and analysis.
                This website will be used to blog about GIS, Technology and anything else I might find interesting. Additionally,
                I will also post tutorials and keep an updated portfolio here. Feel free to contact me if you have any
                questions or would like me to create a specific tutorial. </p>

            <h3>First Post:</h3>

            <p>Currently working on a couple different spatial analyses. First I have been trying my hand at some business
            location analysis, I'm mainly following this text
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Business-Site-Selection-Location-Analysis/dp/0470191066/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1548516295&sr=8-2&keywords=Business+location+analysis">here.</a>
            It's a fairly simple and well organized book, not overly technical in regards to GIS and helpful with the underlying
            theory of finding good business locations and the logistics of running a larger business. Second I am going
            back to an older project I did for a Non-Profit a while back. I created a model for them to analyze an entire
            county for the best farmland and prioritize it for conservation (they were updating a farmland protection plan).
            A couple years later and they need an update and I am more than happy to help d: I have improved my GIS and programming skills
            and can't wait to see what I can do now! Unfortunately, I did this project using ArcMap and while I love
            QGIS; due to time constraints, files being in geodatabase format, and the use of model builder; I will have to
            make my improvements using ESRI software. Not to worry though, after this project is done and I have some free time
                I will upload a tutorial on creating a LESA model using ArcMap AND another doing it in QGIS (after I figure that out of course).
            In the meantime you can actually check out my older version of the model and the write-up for it
            <a href="http://occainfo.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Appendix-C_LESA.pdf">here.</a> Im open to critique and suggestions for the update, but go easy this was my first major project
            while I was still in college (>'.')> </p>
